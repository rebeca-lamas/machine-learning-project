                <h1>Data Cleaning</h1>
                <p>
                    The four batches of data for a single year were imported and then combined into a single 
                    dataframe. Any movies that were not released in the United States was dropped. If it had 
                    been released in multiple counties those values were kept as long as the United States was 
                    included in them. Any movies that did not have box office information were dropped from our 
                    data set. The dataframe was then filtered so that each row had at least seven features that 
                    were not null. At this point the dataframe was exported as compiled_2016_data to a csv so 
                    that if we needed to start from this point later we could. Though we continued from this point 
                    to transform the data to the format we needed for out models. 
                </p>
                <h5>Multiple Linear Regression Cleaning</h5>
                <p>
                    Next we transformed out dataframe to the format we would need for it to be for our models. 
                    The columns were filtered so that it included only: title, box_office, country, genre, production, 
                    rating, and runtime. Next country was transformed from a list of countries to a count of the number of 
                    countries where it was released. Many movies had multiple genres listed; thus we also transformed it 
                    from a list of genres to a count of the number of genres. Rating had values of 'Not Rated' as well as 'Unrated'. 
                    We determined these were the same, and thus replaced all 'Not Rated' values with 'Unrated'. Any 
                    na values in the rating column were filled with 'Unrated'. Runtime had 'min' included with the value and it 
                    was transformed so that it was only an integer and any na values were replaced with 0. Any null values for production 
                    were filled with 'NaN'. Box office was transformed into an integer and various characters were removed. 
                    A year column was added and the value was set to 2016 for the 2016 data and 2017 for when 2017 was cleaned. 
                    This will enable us to filter by year later when it is time to model. This dataframe was exported as a CSV 
                    called 'train_data_2016' and for 2017 it was called 'test_data_2017' since 2016 will be used to train and 
                    2017 will be used to test.
                </p>
                <h5>Logistical Regression Cleaning</h5>
                <p>The Logistical Regression model followed all of the same cleaning as above but needed to go one step further. Currently 
                    our target of box office is not a categorical data, but continuous. Thus we sorted the dataframe by ascending for box 
                    office. Then we set the top two box office's to a value of 1 and the rest were set to 0. This dataframe was 
                    exported as a CSV called 'train.log_data_2016' and for 2017 it was called 'test.log_data_2017' since 2016 will be used to train and 
                    2017 will be used to test.
