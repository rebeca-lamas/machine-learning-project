                <h1>Data Cleaning</h1>
                <p>
                    The four batches of data for a single year were imported and then combined into a 
                    single data frame. Any movies that were not released in the United States was dropped. 
                    If it had been released in multiple countries those values were kept as long as the 
                    United States was included in them. Any movies that did not have box office 
                    information were dropped from our data set as well. The data frame was then 
                    filtered so that each row had at least seven features that were not null. At this 
                    point the data frame was exported as cleaned_2016_data to a csv so that if we 
                    needed to start from this point later we could. After the data was cleaned, we continued 
                    from this point to transform the data to the format we needed for out models.
                </p>
                <h5>Multiple Linear Regression Cleaning</h5>
                <p>
                    First the columns were filtered so that it included only: title, box_office, 
                    country, genre, production, rating, and runtime. Next we had to transform our 
                    data so that all of the features were numerical values. Country contained 
                    all of the countries a movie was released in and genre contained all of the 
                    genres it was categorized as. Both of these features were transformed to 
                    counts of the respective values. Rating had values of 'Not Rated' as well as 
                    'Unrated'. We determined these were the same, and thus replaced all 'Not Rated' 
                    values with 'Unrated'. As well any na values in the rating column were filled 
                    with 'Unrated'. Runtime had 'min' included with the value and it was transformed 
                    so that it was only an integer and any na values were replaced with 0. Any null 
                    values for production were filled with 'NaN'. Box office was transformed into an 
                    integer by removing dollar signs and commas. A year column was added and the 
                    value was set to based on the year it represented. This will enable us to filter 
                    by year later when it is time to model. This dataframe was exported as a CSV 
                    called 'train_data_2016' and for 2017 it was called 'test_data_2017' since 2016 
                    will be used to train and 2017 will be used to test.
                </p>
                <h5>Logistical Regression Cleaning</h5>
                <p>
                    The Logistical Regression model followed all of the same cleaning as above 
                    but needed to go one step further. Currently our target of box office is 
                    not categorical data, but rather is continuous. Thus we sorted the data frame 
                    by ascending for box office. Then we set the top twenty box offices to a 
                    value of 1 and the rest were set to 0. This dataframe was exported as a CSV 
                    called 'train.log_data_2016' and for 2017 it was called 'test.log_data_2017' 
                    since 2016 will be used to train and 2017 will be used to test.
