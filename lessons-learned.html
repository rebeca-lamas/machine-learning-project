                <h5>Limitations</h5>
                <p>
                    Our models are only as good as our datasets and our datasets were limited in size. 
                    For each year we webscraped more than 3,000 titles but after eliminating those 
                    without data for box office we were left with about 250 titles per year. This is 
                    a large reduction in our size of data. Furthermore, when we dove into seeing how 
                    we wanted to handle such a large gap in data, we found our box office numbers 
                    did not match numbers we found while googling. This could be that the other 
                    numbers online were box offices for multiple countries, or for a longer period 
                    of time versus opening weekend numbers. Our data's accuracy is also limited to 
                    how accurate the user was that created the list that was originally web scraped. 
                    In web scraping a few 2015 movies were returned but had been included in the 2016 list of movies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another limitation was in the limited API calls we were allowed. Given our 
                    time table, we only had the time and resources to compile data for 2016-2018. 
                    We had planned to use 2018 to validate our model but it had even less data for 
                    box office compared to 2016 and 2017. Instead of having approximately 250 
                    records for box office, it had about 25. With such a dramatic drop in size, we 
                    decided it would not be meaningful to use it to validate. Hindsight we wish we 
                    had pulled the data for 2015 instead of 2018 but we had no way of knowing that 
                    it would have such little data for box office.
                </p>
                <h5>Next Steps</h5>
                <p>
                    Our model currently has very promising results, though we are curious 
                    to see if it would still be as accurate with larger and more complete 
                    data sets. Given more time, we could compile complete datasets for 2000 - 2015 
                    thus enabling us to train and test from 2000 - 2017 versus our current scope of 2016 -2017.
                    In addition, training and testing different models outside of linear and logistical would be 
                    beneficial.
