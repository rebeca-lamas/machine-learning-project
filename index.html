                <h1>Driving Question</h1>
                <h5>Can machine learning predict the box office for a movie being released next year?</h5>
                <p> 
                    At the end of the day, whether how much money a movie makes is a large factor in whether it will 
                    be deemed successful or not. A model that could predict its box office amount would be extremely 
                    useful to movie franchises.
                </p>
                <h5>Can it predict if it is in the top ten?</h5>
                <p>
                    Predicting an exact box office can be challenging and likely would not have a very accurate model. 
                    But do we care more about know the exact dollar amount of the movie's box office, or do we care more 
                    about if it is in the top 20 movies for box office for the year? Changing out questioin to a categorical 
                    question could lead to a more accurate model. 
                </p>
                <h5>Project Overview</h5>
                <p>
                    Originally, we wanted to predict this for movies being realeased in 2020. Though as we began 
                    to dive into the data we realized there was not enough information made public for 2020 movies. 
                    We began to look at previous years to find the most recent years that had enough data to make 
                    a meaningful model. The OMDb API was used to compile our datasets. To make OMDb API calls we 
                    needed to have a complete list of the movies for a given year that were released in the 
                    United States. We found lists that users created on IMDB that provided this information. 
                    These lists were webscraped using python and beautiful soup, then exported as CSVs. OMDb has 
                    a max of 1000 API calls per day for their free tier. Thus we split our titles for 2016 and 2017 
                    into 4 batches that were no longer than 1000 records. Then each list was iterated through and API 
                    calls were made. The information was transformed and exported as CSVs. Now we had four files of data 
                    for 2016, and four files of data for 2017. Then the CSVs were compiled so that 2016 data was contained 
                    in one file. Once our data was compiled into their respective year, it was time to clean our data and 
                    transform it into the form we needed for our models. Once transformed these were exported as train_data_2016
                    and test_data_2017. A logistical regression model was created to answer our categorical question of is the 
                    movie going to be in the top 20 for the year. A multiple linear regression model was created to answer our 
                    continuous question of can we predict the box office. After creating our two models we began to examine the 
                    advantages and disadvantages of one model over another. This is shown in our comparision page. Throughout 
                    our project journey, we have found limitations and next steps we would like to take next.
